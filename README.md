# 🚀 Applied Data Science Capstone – IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my **Applied Data Science Capstone Project**, completed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on **Coursera**.
The project demonstrates end-to-end data science skills — including data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling — applied to a real-world dataset.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this capstone is to apply the full data science workflow to solve a practical problem using data-driven insights.
In this project, we explore **SpaceX Falcon 9 launch records** to determine the factors that influence **rocket landing success**, and to build a model that predicts the likelihood of a successful landing.

---

## 📊 Key Tasks

* **Data Collection:**
  Gathered launch data from SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

* **Data Wrangling:**
  Cleaned and formatted the dataset for analysis using `pandas`.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  Explored relationships between variables through visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

* **Interactive Dashboards:**
  Built interactive visual dashboards using `Plotly Dash` to display launch performance insights.

* **Predictive Modeling:**
  Used `Scikit-Learn` to build classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM) to predict landing success.

---

## 🧠 Tools and Libraries

* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, plotly, dash, beautifulsoup4, requests
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Results Summary

* Identified that **payload mass** and **booster version** significantly influence landing outcomes.
* The **best machine learning model** achieved an accuracy of around **83%** in predicting successful landings.
* Created an **interactive dashboard** to visualize launch success rates by site and payload mass.
